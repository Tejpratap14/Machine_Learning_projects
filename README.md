***Iris dataset analysis - Classification***

This project involves categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their measurements. The goal is to accurately predict the species of a given iris flower based on these measurements and evaluating the model's performance


**Dataset Information:**

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
